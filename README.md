VRangeSync is a command-line utility which copy and move data from one location to another on a storage device. It is a data migration, cloner, file replication and synchronization software. VRangeSync is able to provides four-ways sync. It aims to be your system 'Swiss Army knife', handling a wide variety of data security backup and administration tasks. It include  deltacopy algorithm that transfer new changes without copy the whole file (eg. transfer only 3GB of new data out of the 2TB file) .  It support resume of partial file transfer. It had the ability to 'move' files within 'Destination machine' which skip the hassle of transfer the same file again. It significantly reduces the costs and technical expertise required to manage data migration activities. Through automation, you can dramatically reduce administration time.

    -An example how to use Vrangesync startup script (vr), a wrapper to run the 'vrex' 
  

A collection of static binary files
=============================================
